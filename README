DOT RAILS - a plugin that enables per-user, out-of-band configuration files.

With this plugin in your rails app, you can have your own environment.rb 
and database.yml files inside a .rails directory on your home directory. 

The database config (~/.rails/{app-name}-database.yml) replaces the values 
defined in config/database.yml for your application. Where as the environment
file (~/.rails/{app-name}-environment.rb) is loaded in addition to the
"official" environment.rb, allowing you to define additional settings.

As you can see, both file names are prefixed by your "application name". The
plugin tries to guess it by looking at the name of the directory containing
your rails app, but you can override this by defining a RAILS_APP environment
variable or ruby constant.
